Donald Trump's 2024 campaign has been criticized by the media for making increasingly violent and authoritarian statements,[87][88][89] which some believe the Trump campaign is intentionally leaning into.[90] Trump's previous comments suggesting he can "terminate" the Constitution to reverse his election loss,[91][92] his claim that he would only be a dictator on "day one" of his presidency and not after,[a] his promise to use the Justice Department to go after his political enemies,[99] attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election, continued Republican efforts to restrict voting following the 2020 presidential election, and Trump's baseless predictions of vote fraud in the 2024 election,[100] have raised concerns over the state of democracy in America.[90][101][102][103]
