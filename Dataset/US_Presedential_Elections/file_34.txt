In 1948, it was the Democrats once again that divided, with two third parties flaking off from either side — a Southern-oriented States’ Rights Democratic Party (the Dixiecrats) on the right and a new-era Progressive Party on the left. For much of the campaign, Democratic President Harry S. Truman looked like a goner. But he was able to rally the core of the party in the fall to dispatch his heavily favored Republican opponent, Thomas E. Dewey, with 49.5% of the vote.
