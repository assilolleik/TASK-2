By September 2020, several hundred legal cases relating to the election had been filed.[227] About 250 of these had to do with the mechanics of voting in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic.[227] The Supreme Court ruled on a number of these cases,[228] primarily issuing emergency stays instead of going through the normal process due to the urgency.[229] In October 2020, there was speculation that the election might be decided through a Supreme Court case, as happened following the 2000 election.[230][231]
