On June 20, 2020, Trump's campaign held an in-person rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, after the Oklahoma Supreme Court ruled that the event could go ahead despite continuing concerns over COVID-19.[130] Attendance at the rally was far lower than expected, being described as a "flop", and it led to a significant worsening of relations between Trump and his campaign manager, Brad Parscale.[131] 7.7 million people watched the event on Fox News, a Saturday audience record for that channel.[132] Three weeks after the rally, the Oklahoma State Department of Health recorded record numbers of cases of COVID-19,[133] and former Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain died of the virus, although it was not confirmed that he caught the disease due to his attendance at the rally.[134]
