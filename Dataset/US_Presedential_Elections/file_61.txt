While Trump still dominated rural America as a whole, there were rural areas that he lost. Biden won 50.5% of the rural counties that each had mostly non-white voters, particularly in the South and the West.[332] Rural counties in the South won by Biden had greater economic distress than those won by Trump; in the Northeast, the opposite was true.[332] In the West, Biden did especially well in rural counties that had high shares of workers employed in leisure and hospitality.[332] Such counties likewise had large constituencies of immigration from other states.[332] Every state won by Biden was won by more votes than those by which Hillary Clinton won the state. The combined vote margin of these states was equal to Biden's gain over Hillary Clinton.[333] Biden became the oldest president ever elected, besting Ronald Reagan's record in 1984, and the oldest non-incumbent ever, besting Trump in 2016.
