In 1948, California was several decades away from taking on the navy shade of blue that we know it for today. As Harry Truman surprised political observers to win a full term as president that year, he carried California by less than half a percentage point, which put him over 270 electoral votes on our continuum. But Truman’s national popular vote margin over Republican Thomas Dewey was considerably more comfortable — he prevailed by just under a 50%-45% vote, or 4.5 percentage points. With that, the Electoral College would have had a 4-point pro-Republican “bias” in the context of 1948.
