During his first — and unsuccessful — run for the presidency, in 1960, Ohio backed Richard Nixon over Kennedy. But in both of Nixon’s successful elections, 1968 and 1972, Ohio was crucial. In his close 1968 win over Democrat Hubert Humphrey, it had a 1.6-point pro-Republican bias. Then, four years later, under a completely different electoral environment, Ohio remained the tipping point state: as the then-incumbent Nixon won in a 49-state landslide, Ohio assumed a 1.6-point bias in the Democratic direction.
