Hypothetically, let’s imagine a world in which Biden is winning the national popular vote by Hillary Clinton’s 2-point margin from 2016, as we see a continuation of some of the trends we saw in 2022 (blue states getting a little less blue, red states getting a little redder, etc.). Perhaps Biden also bleeds more votes to third-party options than his Republican opponent, which also slightly reduces his national margin. In this scenario, the 226 electoral votes noted above where Biden overperformed his national margin remain more Democratic than the nation.
