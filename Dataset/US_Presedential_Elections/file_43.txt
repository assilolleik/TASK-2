From 1984 to 1992, the Electoral College had a narrow but persistent Republican bias. In 1984 and 1988, the key state remained in the Midwest, as Michigan was the tipping point state. Then, in 1992, Tennessee provided Bill Clinton’s 270th electoral vote — this may also have vindicated his selection of Al Gore, a Tennessee senator, as his vice presidential pick, as Gore was considered a somewhat unconventional pick at the time. But by 1996, the modern coalition of red and blue states was beginning to align and the tipping point state that year was Pennsylvania, which, unlike Tennessee, is a present-day swing state.
