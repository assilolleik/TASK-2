The third scheduled debate took place on October 22 at Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee, and was moderated by Kristen Welker.[254][255] The changes to the debate rules, which included the candidates' microphones being muted while the other was speaking,[256] resulted in it being generally considered more civil than the first debate.[257] Welker's performance as moderator was praised, with her being regarded as having done a good job preventing the candidates from interrupting each other.[258] Biden was generally held to have won the debate, though it was considered unlikely to alter the race to any considerable degree.[259][260][261]
