Prior to 1967, many presidential candidates disclosed assets, stock holdings, and other information which might affect the public trust.[66] In that year, Republican candidate George W. Romney went a step further and released his tax returns for the previous twelve years.[66] Since then, many presidential candidates – including all major-party nominees from 1980 to 2012 – have released some of their returns,[67] although few of the major party nominees have equaled or exceeded George Romney's twelve.[68][69] The Tax History Project – a project directed by Joseph J. Thorndike and established by the nonprofit Tax Analysts group[70] – has compiled the publicly released tax returns of presidents and presidential candidates (including primary candidates).[71]
