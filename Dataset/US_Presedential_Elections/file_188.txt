Belva A. Lockwood was a teacher and school principal before she became a lawyer. Overcoming many barriers before gaining admission to a law school and to legal practice strengthened her resolve to improve the legal and social status of women. She sought legislation to change womenâ€™s second-class status in pay, professional opportunities, and domestic life, and she became active with the National Woman Suffrage Association. Due to her efforts Congress passed a law in 1879 allowing female attorneys to practice in the federal court system. Lockwood then became the first woman to be admitted to the U.S. Supreme Court bar, and in 1880 the first woman to argue before the court. In 1884 she agreed to be the candidate for President of the National Equal Rights Party and massed over 4,000 votes; she would run again in 1888.
