This is the second time a president has been impeached during his first term while running for a second term.[103][i] Trump continued to hold campaign rallies during the impeachment.[105][106] This is also the first time since the modern presidential primaries were established in 1911 that a president has been subjected to impeachment while the primary season was underway.[107] The impeachment process overlapped with the primary campaigns, forcing senators running for the Democratic nomination to remain in Washington for the trial in the days before and after the Iowa caucuses.[108][109]
