As Trump was ousted in 2020, data-minded Republicans could take some comfort in the fact that the Electoral College’s bias continued to drift in their favor. In a sense, we’ve come full circle on Table 1: in both 1948 and 2020, Democrats won the national popular vote by 4.5 points but only carried the tipping point state by about half a percentage point. Indeed, the 3.8-point pro-Republican bias of the Electoral College was the highest since 1948. In 2020, Biden patched up Democrats’ Midwestern “Blue Wall” by narrowly returning Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin into the blue column, and he also managed a couple of historic flips in Arizona and Georgia. But all those states were more Republican than the national popular vote — that had not been the case for those Blue Wall states in the Obama era.
