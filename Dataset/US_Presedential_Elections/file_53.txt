In 1976, 11 states were decided by less than 2 percentage points, the most of any election that Table 1 considers. The tipping point state that year was Wisconsin â€” on the ABC Election Night footage linked to above, Wisconsin happened to be called right before Hawaii came in, pushing Carter over 270 in their count. Four years later, the tipping state was just south of Wisconsin. As Ronald Reagan ousted Carter, the state where he was born (Illinois) had a nearly 2-point pro-Democratic bias.
