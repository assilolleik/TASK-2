McMullin is a Provo-born graduate of Brigham Young University who possesses a Republican pedigree. He is running as a personally “civil,” conservative alternative to Trump. The Republican nominee did not fare well in Mormon Utah’s Republican caucuses earlier this year, and has shed GOP backing in the Beehive State since then. The result is that bright red Utah is in play with a mid-October Emerson College poll showing McMullin in the lead with 31%, Trump with 27%, and Clinton with 24%. If McMullin manages to be elected “president of Utah,” he will earn six electoral votes.
