The 2020 Democratic National Convention was originally scheduled for July 13–16 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin,[86][87][88] but was delayed to August 17–20 due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.[89] On June 24, 2020, it was announced that the convention would be held in a mixed online in-person format, with most delegates attending remotely but a few still attending the physical convention site.[90] On August 5, the in-person portion of the convention was scaled down even further; major speeches, including Biden's, were switched to a virtual format.[91]
