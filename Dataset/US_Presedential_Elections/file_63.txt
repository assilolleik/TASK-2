In 1956, Missouri, then a prime bellwether state, was notable because it was the sole Eisenhower-to-Stevenson state, although the Democrat carried it narrowly. But by 1960, Missouri seemed to regain its swing state image. In another narrow result, it backed the winning Democrat, John F. Kennedy, and was the tipping-point state that election — its result mirrored the national vote closely. Four years later, Washington state was the tipping point state in Lyndon Johnson’s landslide. The Electoral College had a Democratic bias in 1964 in part because the Deep South, where resentment over Johnson’s civil rights legislation was apparent, acted as something of a “sink” for Republican nominee Barry Goldwater’s votes.
