Judged by the standards of such past presidents as George Bush, Jimmy Carter, and Richard Nixon, Gore’s shortcomings as a politician are not especially notable. None of these leaders would be considered “naturals” in the realm of politics. But in the context of 2000, and in the wake of the master politician Bill Clinton, Gore’s personal style might have made a critical difference. While Bush fell well short of Clinton on substantive knowledge and a capacity to use speeches, press conferences, and other public events to connect with millions of citizens, his affable and engaging personal manner, and reputation for bipartisanship and straight talk, drew a clear contrast with Gore and overshadowed his other personal shortcomings.
