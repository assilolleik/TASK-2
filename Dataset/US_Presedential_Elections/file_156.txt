The winner of this election is scheduled to be inaugurated on January 20, 2025. It will occur at the same time as elections relating to the U.S. Senate, House, gubernatorial, and state legislative. On March 12, Biden and Trump became the presumptive nominees for the Democratic and Republican parties respectively by clinching a majority of delegates, although they have yet to be confirmed at the nominating conventions.[4] Robert F. Kennedy Jr. emerged as the first major third-party presidential candidate since Ross Perot[5] in the 1992 and 1996 elections, running as an independent.[6] His polling is at the highest levels for a candidate outside the two major parties since Ross Perot in 1992.[7][8]
