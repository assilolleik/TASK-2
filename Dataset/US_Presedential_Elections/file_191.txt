The United States has provided significant military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine throughout the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[133][134][135] Democratic politicians and a significant number of Republican politicians have supported this plan, arguing that the United States has a significant role to play in "protecting democracy and fighting Russian aggression."[136] Some candidates, including Ron DeSantis and Donald Trump, claim that Ukraine and suppressing Russian intervention should not be a significant interest to the United States, and that the plan should be more limited.[137] Vivek Ramaswamy favors ending U.S. military aid to Ukraine and would recognize Russian annexed territories.[138]
