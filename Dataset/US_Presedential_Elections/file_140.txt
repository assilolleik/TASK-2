Historically, there does not seem to be a clear connection between the outcome of a Presidential election and capital market performance in the medium- to long-term.  Two scenarios corresponded to positive absolute returns in excess of long-term average returns – Democratic control of the White House and full Republican control of Congress; or Democratic control of the White House and split control of the Senate and House. One scenario corresponded to positive absolute returns modestly below long-term averages – Republican control of the White House and full Democratic control of Congress.
