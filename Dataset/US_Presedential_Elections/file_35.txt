In 1912, it was the reigning Republicans who split in two, which was as much a personal grudge match as an ideological reckoning. President William Howard Taft and former President Theodore Roosevelt battled through the Republican primaries and then on through the general election. Roosevelt, leading the breakaway Progressive Party (known colloquially as the Bull Moose Party), drew more popular and electoral votes than the Republican standard-bearer, Taft. But with the GOP vote split, Democrat Woodrow Wilson won more of both than either, and was easily elected president with 41.8% of the vote. The Socialists were the fourth party in the 1912 race, taking their highest share of the vote ever (6.0%).
