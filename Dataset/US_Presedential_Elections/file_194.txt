Donald Trump has stated that if elected, he would increase deportations, send the U.S. military to the border, expand ICE detentions, deputize local law enforcement to handle border security, increase Customs and Border Patrol funding as well as finish building the wall on the southern border.[82] The Biden administration has undertaken a policy of providing temporary protections to migrants from certain countries such as Venezuela, Ukraine, Nicaragua, Cuba and Haiti.[82] In February 2024, Biden and congressional negotiators reached an agreement on a bill to secure the border, but the bill was opposed by Trump. Biden has pushed back on Republican claims that he could secure the border without Congress.[84]
