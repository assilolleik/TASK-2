What would have to happen for the Electoral College’s bias to move back in the Democratic direction? Well, we actually don’t have to look very far back in history: in short, the 2024 election would have to look more like the 2022 midterms. Last year, Democrats underperformed, but still won statewide contests, in California and New York. Meanwhile, Democratic gubernatorial candidates in Florida and Texas lost statewide by margins that were much greater than Biden’s 2020 deficit in their states. At the same time, many of the states that were marginal in 2020 did not shift right in 2022 — in fact, Michigan and Pennsylvania looked bluer last year than they did in 2020.
