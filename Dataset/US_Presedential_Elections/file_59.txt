As an aside, the concept of the tipping point state is not related to the order in which states are called on Election Night, although the 270 threshold is key in both scenarios. In 1976, for example, ABC News declared Jimmy Carter the winner after Hawaiiâ€™s 4 electoral votes bumped his total up to 272. Similarly, on Election Night 2008, several outlets were able to call the presidency for Barack Obama at 11 p.m. sharp, or immediately after polls closed in four deeply blue Pacific Coast states that were collectively worth 77 electoral votes.
