On September 26, the day after Justice Ginsburg's body lay in state at the Capitol, Trump held a Rose Garden ceremony at the White House to announce and introduce his candidate, Amy Coney Barrett.[222] After four days of confirmation hearings, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted the nomination out of committee on October 22,[223] and on October 26, Barrett was confirmed on a party-line vote of 52â€“48, with no Democrats voting for her confirmation.[224] This was the closest Supreme Court confirmation ever to a presidential election, and the first Supreme Court nomination since 1869 with no supporting votes from the minority party.[224] It was also one of the fastest timelines from nomination to confirmations in U.S. history.[225][226]
