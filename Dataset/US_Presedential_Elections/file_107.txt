The House of Representatives voted an emergency grant of $25Â billion to the post office to facilitate the predicted flood of mail ballots.[206] Although Trump has repeatedly denounced mail voting, he has mailed in ballots due to being in a different state than the one where he votes at the time of the election.[207] In August 2020, Trump conceded that the post office would need additional funds to handle the additional mail-in voting, but said he would block any additional funding for the post office to prevent any increase in balloting by mail.[208]
