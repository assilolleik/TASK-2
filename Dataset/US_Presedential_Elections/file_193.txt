During Lincoln’s second presidential campaign this propaganda piece suggested the “worst” social outcome for Lincoln’s abolition of slavery. Engineered by the racist, anti-war New York World, the picture depicted a topsy-turvy future in which the President (left) might actually bow to a woman of color; mixed-race couples (including Horace Greeley, editor of the anti-slavery New York Tribune, right, introduces his Black friend), courted in public; and white coachmen might “shockingly” drive African-American couples instead of the other way around.  Lincoln won New York State for the second time in 1864, but the race-baiting campaign about him drove down his majority.
