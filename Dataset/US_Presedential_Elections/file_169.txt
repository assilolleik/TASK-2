Some polling for this election has indicated that Democratic strength among Hispanic, Asian, Arab, and youth voters appears to have somewhat eroded, while Republicans' durability with Whites and voters over the age of 65 also appears to be slipping.[53][54][55][56][57] However, some political analysts[58] have argued that these apparent trends in polling are not representative of the actual electorate, and are a polling mirage resulting from poor sampling months before the election, large numbers of voters who do not think the election will be between Biden and Trump,[59] and heavy non-response bias.[60][61][62][63] Other pollsters, such as YouGov, have shown no statistically significant generational or racial depolarization among the electorate.[64][65]
