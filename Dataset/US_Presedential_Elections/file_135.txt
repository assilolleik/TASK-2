While the 2024 presidential contest is likely to dominate the news this year in the runup to the general election in November, it is one of many political contests that could have an impact on public policy going forward. Not to be overlooked are races for the U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives. Democrats currently hold an effective two-seat majority in the Senate, with one-third of the seats up for election in November. Republicans currently hold a very narrow majority in the House, with all seats up for election this year. Control of Congress is as much an open question as the outcome of the presidential race.
