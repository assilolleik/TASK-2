In presidential elections since 1948, the tipping point states have tracked closer to the national popular vote. In the 1950s, Republican Dwight Eisenhower came out on the winning end of two bouts with Democrat Adlai Stevenson. Though Eisenhower’s 1956 victory was more comfortable than his 1952 win, as he increased his popular vote margin from 10.8% to 15.4%, he had a less efficient coalition his second time around. In 1952, Michigan, the tipping point state, was slightly more Republican than the national vote, while in 1956, Florida was about a point more Democratic than the nation.
