On November 6, Biden assumed leads in Pennsylvania and Georgia as the states continued to count ballots, and absentee votes in those states heavily favored Biden.[416] Due to the slim margin between Biden and Trump in the state, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger announced on NovemberÂ 6 that a recount would be held in Georgia. At that point, Georgia had not seen "any widespread irregularities" in this election, according to the voting system manager of the state, Gabriel Sterling.[417]
