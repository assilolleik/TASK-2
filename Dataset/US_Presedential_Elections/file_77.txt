Just a few weeks before the election, Martin Luther King Jr. was arrested while participating in a protest in Atlanta, Georgia. Although it was politically risky, John Kennedy phoned his wife, Coretta Scott King, to express his concern, while a call from Robert Kennedy to the judge helped secure her husband's safe release. The Kennedys' personal intervention led to a public endorsement by Martin Luther King Sr., the influential father of the civil rights leader. The publicizing of this endorsement, combined with other campaign efforts, contributed to increased support among Black voters for Kennedy.
