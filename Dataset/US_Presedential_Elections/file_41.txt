No third-party candidate since then has won an electoral vote, a number that includes Ross Perot. The wealthy Texan ran as an independent in 1992 and captured 18.9% of the vote. His cross-country appeal was impressive, as he won at least 20% of the vote in 28 states (including California, Massachusetts, Ohio, and Texas), at least 25% in eight of these states, and 30% in one (Maine). Yet Perot failed to win a single state or a single electoral vote.
