In the recent past, third parties have had a hand in abetting that process. In 1968, Wallace acted as a way station for Southern whites making their way from the Democratic to Republican parties. In short order, the South went from being a Democratic bastion to a cornerstone of the GOP â€” first at the presidential level, then at all levels of government.
