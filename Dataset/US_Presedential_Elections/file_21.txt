One exchange that was particularly noted was when Trump did not directly denounce the white supremacist and neo-fascist group Proud Boys, instead responding that they should "stand back and stand by".[240][241][242] On the next day, Trump told reporters the group should "stand down" while also claiming that he was not aware of what the group was.[243][244] The debate was described as "chaotic and nearly incoherent" because of Trump's repeated interruptions, causing the CPD to consider adjustments to the format of the remaining debates.[245]
