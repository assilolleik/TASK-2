Significant third parties have managed to affect the outcome over the years by winning enough votes to flip a critical state or two from one major party to the other. That happened in 2000, when Green Party nominee Ralph Nader took nearly 100,000 votes in Florida, a state where Republican George W. Bush emerged the certified winner over Democrat Al Gore by just 537 votes. To this day, many Democrats maintain that Nader cost them the election, as Bushâ€™s national margin of victory was only five electoral votes.
