Under the Biden administration, several rounds of student loan forgiveness have been issued, totaling over $132 billion. The forgiveness has largely focused on public servants, people who were defrauded, and people in repayment for long periods of time.[122] In August 2022, Biden announced he would sign an executive order that would forgive large amounts of student debt, including $10,000 for student loan debt for single graduates making less than $125,000 or married couples making less than $250,000 and $20,000 for recipients of Pell Grants.[123][124] In June 2023, this plan was overturned in the Supreme Court decision Biden v. Nebraska.[125][126] In the aftermath of the decision, Biden has continued with more limited student loan forgiveness.[122] His plans have been criticized by Republicans as irresponsible spending.[127] Biden stated that offering universal pre-kindergarten services as well as caregiver support would be a priority of a second term.[128]
