“… it was not from any fanatical zeal, or lack of knowledge of the real political situation of the country on the part of the nominees; but to test the Constitutional right of a woman to be nominated and elected to that supreme office. … to find a woman brave enough to meet the ordeal….The test was made, and the legal and political aspect of the woman question discussed not only by pulpit, press and forum, but in every palace and hovel from ….to the ‘Golden Gate’ and from the ‘Lakes’ to the ‘Gulf.’ It may have been the amusing side of the campaign, but …a dense forest of ignorance has been blazed for a coming woman president. I am not anxious to know at this stage who that woman will be, but believe it not only possible but probable in the future of this country.”
