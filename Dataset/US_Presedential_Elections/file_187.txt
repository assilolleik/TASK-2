“Hunkers” was a pejorative term referring to a New York Democratic Party political faction—hence the donkey (jackass)—that consented to political compromises to allow the continuation and spread of slavery; its opponents, the “Barnburners,” were antislavery. The Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854, which permitted voters in each territory to decide whether to allow slavery as they became states, led to violence in Kansas and more polarization around the issue throughout the nation. In 1856 James Buchanan won as a Democrat over John Freemont (Republican) and Millard Fillmore (American Party). With the Dred Scott decision by the Supreme Court soon after his inauguration (holding that Congress could not deny slave owners their property in any U.S. territory), Buchanan was overtaken by the differences that would tear apart the Union at the end of his presidency.
