The Census Bureau has collected voting and registration data since 1964 and has fielded the Voting and Registration Supplement to the Current Population Survey every two years. This survey is the most comprehensive data source available on the social and demographic composition of the electorate in federal elections. Examining these characteristics and how they have changed over the years provides a better understanding of the social and demographic characteristics of American voters.
