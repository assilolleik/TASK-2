After primary elections held in several states on March 12, nominees for President in both parties appear to be locked in. Democratic President Joe Biden’s victory in the Georgia primary secured enough delegates to win his party’s nomination. Former President Donald Trump was projected as having enough delegates to win the Republican nomination after sweeping contests in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington state. Barring unforeseen circumstances, it appears that the stage is set for a rematch of 2020’s race for the White House. Notably, the candidates don’t officially become their parties’ nominees until national party conventions this summer.
