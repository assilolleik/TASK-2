Bush v. Gore may have been the first time in modern history a president was elected despite losing the popular vote, but it wasn't the last. In 2016, businessman and reality TV host Donald Trump defeated former first lady, senator and secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton, even though she received three million more votes than him in the popular vote. The election was unprecedented in many other ways. Trump, who ran despite never having held elected office, brought unabashed populism to the campaign trail.
