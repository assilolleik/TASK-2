On March 4, 2024, the United States Supreme Court ruled unanimously that Maine could not remove Donald Trump (R) from its presidential primary ballot. The Court wrote, "responsibility for enforcing Section 3 [of the 14th Amendment] against federal officeholders and candidates rests with Congress and not the States." The opinion said that 14th Amendment enforcement in federal elections was not specifically delegated to the states and that "an evolving electoral map could dramatically change the behavior of voters, parties, and States across the country, in different ways and at different times. The disruption would be all the more acute—and could nullify the votes of millions and change the election result—if Section 3 enforcement were attempted after the Nation has voted. Nothing in the Constitution requires that we endure such chaos—arriving at any time or different times, up to and perhaps beyond the Inauguration."[15]
