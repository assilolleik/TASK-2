Gradually throughout the years, the states began conducting popular elections to choose their slate of electors. In 1800, only five of the 16 states chose electors by a popular vote; by 1824, after the rise of Jacksonian democracy, the proportion of states that chose electors by popular vote had sharply risen to 18 out of 24 states.[17] This gradual movement toward greater democratization coincided with a gradual decrease in property restrictions for the franchise.[17] By 1840, only one of the 26 states (South Carolina) still selected electors by the state legislature.[18]
