The Python package Beautiful Soup was used because of its strong parsing capabilities, which made it possible to extract useful information from HTML texts quickly. The work was made easier by using Beautiful Soup, which allowed for the deliberate retrieval of paragraphs while maintaining data integrity and following predetermined word count requirements."
